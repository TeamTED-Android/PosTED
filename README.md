1. Description:
Our project is a mobile place of sale application, mainly for laptops and coming soon - smart phones. It uses a SQLite local database and Kinvey based remote one.
Future plans also include gentrification of the objects to be sold, peer to peer selling (as opposed to the current adding of products only by the app administrator) and filtering of products.
